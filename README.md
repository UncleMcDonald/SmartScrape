# SmartScrape Studio

SmartScrape Studio is an AI-powered web scraping API that extracts structured data from e-commerce websites. It uses OpenAI's GPT models to intelligently parse content and Selenium for handling dynamic websites.

Demo: https://smart-scrape-five.vercel.app/

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note on Budget Constraints**

Given the $50 budget for the AI Challenge, running a crawler-based application in the cloud (e.g., Render, Railway) can be quite challenging due to memory and timeout limitations.  
To ensure better performance and stability, I kindly suggest running the scraping component **locally**, if possible.

## Setup

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the data-portal directory:
```bash
cd data-portal
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
FLASK_ENV=development
PORT=5000
```

4. Start the Flask server:
```bash
# Development mode
python app.py
```

The backend will run on http://localhost:5000 by default.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the ai-scraper directory:
```bash
cd ai-scraper
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173.

## Anti-Scraping Considerations

**Important**: Avoid making multiple requests to the same website in a short period, especially for sites like Coles. E-commerce websites have sophisticated anti-scraping mechanisms that may:

- Temporarily block your IP address
- Present CAPTCHA challenges
- Rate-limit your access

For batch scraping, it's recommended to:
- Utilize the caching system to reduce duplicate requests
- Add random delays between requests
- Rotate IP addresses using proxy services
- Consider using the `PROXY_LIST` environment variable to specify proxy servers
